Problem Statement:- Telehealth Solution for access to healthcare from anywhere

Solution: DocOnDemand


A website that offers you doctor at your time.
This website is both for doctors and patient.
Doctor:- doctor registers and their authenticity is maintained by admin.
They can tell about their free times and time they be available for meetings
after setting a time, meeting link will be generated
Patient:- first login and then search the doctor according to their name/speciality/city.
there is a page they can look for their confirmed appointments
they will get the meeting link automatically for the confirmed appointments
they can video conference .
so this is our app is what about

note:- there is a special segment of AR/Vr that we are working. we can see the models of various body parts like cardiovascular system, skeletal system.
they can be both accessible to patients and doctors
patients can see them for their knowledge about their disease
also doctors can use them to explain the patients easily about the problem
but we are not able to integrate it but we are planning to do it in future.
models file is there in the repo we can watch and access the model from there 
models file name is Startup.obj this file is made from blender so need to download blender for the same to view the models
for refernce the image of cardiovascular model
