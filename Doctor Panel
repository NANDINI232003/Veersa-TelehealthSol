This project aims to create a comprehensive healthcare management system with distinct functionalities for doctors, patients, and administrators. The system will streamline the process of booking and managing medical appointments, ensuring smooth communication and efficient handling of scheduling.

Key Features:
Separate Login for Doctors, Patients, and Admins:

Doctors: Can manage their profiles, view and manage appointments.
Patients: Can search for doctors, book appointments, and view their appointment history.
Admins: Have access to verify/unverify doctor and patient accounts and oversee the system's operations.
Admin Verification:

Admins have the authority to verify or unverify doctors and patients to ensure the legitimacy of users on the platform.
Doctor Search Functionality:

Patients can search for doctors based on name, specialty, or city, making it easier to find the right medical professional for their needs.
Appointment Booking:

Patients can book appointments in the available slots of doctors. The system will display the doctor's available time slots, and patients can select a convenient time.
Appointment Management for Doctors:

Doctors can confirm or cancel appointments. This flexibility allows doctors to manage their schedules efficiently.
Automated Meeting Scheduling:

Once an appointment is confirmed, the system automatically schedules a meeting and sends notifications to the patient. This ensures that both the doctor and patient are aware of the appointment details.
Workflow:
